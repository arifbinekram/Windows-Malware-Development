# Windows Malware Development Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development and execution of a simple backdoor malware for Windows. The malware allows remote command execution, file upload, and download capabilities. The backdoor runs on a Windows victim machine and connects back to a listener running on a Linux attacker machine.

## Components

- **backdoor.py**: The backdoor script to be executed on the Windows victim machine.
- **listener.py**: The listener script to be executed on the Linux attacker machine.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on both the attacker and victim machines.
2. **PyInstaller**: To convert the backdoor script into an executable file.

### Steps

#### 1. Convert `backdoor.py` to an Executable File

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```sh
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Convert `backdoor.py` to an executable:
   ```sh
   pyinstaller --onefile backdoor.py
   ```
3. Navigate to the `dist` directory to find the executable file:
   ```sh
   cd dist
   ```

#### 2. Transfer the Executable to the Victim Windows Machine

Copy the generated `backdoor.exe` file from the `dist` directory to the victim Windows machine.

#### 3. Run `listener.py` on the Linux Attacker Machine

1. Ensure you have `listener.py` on your Linux machine.
2. Execute the listener script:
   ```sh
   python3 listener.py
   ```

#### 4. Run the Backdoor on the Windows Victim Machine

1. Navigate to the location of the `backdoor.exe` on the Windows victim machine.
2. Execute the backdoor:
   ```sh
   ./backdoor.exe
   ```

#### 5. Control the Victim Machine from the Attacker's Listener Terminal

Once the backdoor is running on the victim machine, you will see a connection established in the listener terminal on the attacker machine. You can now execute commands remotely.

### Command Examples

- **Change Directory**: 
  ```sh
  >> cd <directory_path>
  ```
- **Download a File**: 
  ```sh
  >> download <file_path>
  ```
- **Upload a File**: 
  ```sh
  >> upload <file_path>
  ```
- **Execute a Command**: 
  ```sh
  >> <command>
  ```
